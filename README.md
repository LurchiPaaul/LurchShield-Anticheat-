# Why LurchShield is the best AC
Our anticheat works very differently than 90% of the others. Why? Quite simple: Other anticheat systems try to detect mod menus or similar. 
But what do we care how and with what the player does something? The point is that it was done. This is exactly where we come in. 
Let's say a player harnesses a tank. Then we are not interested in how the player did it, but that the player did it!
(Hopefully you understand what is meant).

# General
1. only things are detected that are also under "features" above. So don't open tickets to tell me that this and that are not detected and don't ban. :brain:
2. I prefer to take a little more time for new features, because on the one hand I have a private life and on the other hand I want to achieve a very low error rate with bans. Of course, this also depends on the settings you make as a customer. :sweat_smile:
After all, I'm just a human being with a private life too, and sometimes I don't feel like doing anything either, just like you have a lazy day every now and then. :kissing_heart:

# Globalban system
1. modder remains modder. No matter if you are a customer or a normal player, you should be on the corresponding Discord or a similar platform. 
The ban remains! Statements like "I just wanted to test the anticheat" are not valid. It is not your task to test the anticheat.

2. If you have a globalban as a customer, you are not affected by it on your server through the bypass. However, a global ban can also be switched off.
