 - If the server uses the feature that it can be used in helicopters, the anticheat will detect this and players will not receive bans.
* **Country Blocker**
 - Players from certain countries can be blocked. Assuming you run an English server, you probably don't want to have German players on that server.
* **BlackListWeapon**
 * The weapons are immediately deleted so that the player does not keep the weapon after an unban. 
* **Anti TriggerExecutor**
 * JobTrigger - Should a modder/cheater attempt to execute this trigger, it will result in an immediate ban. This prevents all players from being caught in handcuffs or similar conditions.
 * MoneyTrigger - As soon as the amount of money received exceeds or falls below the maximum or minimum value, the player in question is banned. This ensures that no money can be obtained by modding or cheating.
* **BlackListVehicle**
